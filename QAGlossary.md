A flexible, enterprise metadata layer spans all your underlying data sources?including flat files, databases, packaged applications, and more. This metadata layer is so open and flexible you can even use existing third-party query and reporting tools against it. Report authors can select the items they want in their report and the Oracle Business Intelligence Server will collect and aggregate the information?even if it exists in disparate data sources. With larger user populations, many queries will have similar content and the Oracle Business Intelligence Server can intelligently reuse previous query results. Queries might also be scheduled to be pre-run so the results are available when the user opens the dashboard.
The Oracle Business Intelligence Server also includes parallel query execution engines, memory management, and high-throughput data connectivity adapters to allow highly efficient data sourcing and aggregation that minimize data retrieval time. This highly scalable platform with clustering and caching capabilities is the heart of what drives the other suite components. Multiple servers can be clustered to provide session replication and automatic failover capabilities. The Oracle Business Intelligence Server delivers mission-critical performance, scalability, and reliability.
Physical, business, and presentation layer mapping are all under IT control. A single click on the physical layer mapping will swap out one data source for another?for example, an upgrade from a legacy Teradata Database to an Oracle Database or a switch from a test system to a production one?so users can continue to report unimpeded by changes to data sources. With the business and presentation layers, intelligent caching services, and a multidimensional calculation and integration engine, the Oracle Business Intelligence Server delivers intelligent request generation and optimized data access services.
